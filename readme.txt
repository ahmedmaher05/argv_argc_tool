this simple code illustrates the basics of using argv/argc in c++ as a simple UI , it can be used in order to make tools in c++ 

objective ( print - reverse - upper - shuffleWord-shuffleStatement - delete - middle - add - random ) along with some simple error handling 

ilustration : read the code , its too simple :) 

examples : 

- Command Line: a1.exe print third year students are honest and clever
Expected output: third year students are honest and clever


- Command Line: a1.exe reverse Cats love rabbits but rabbits hate cats
Expected output: cats hate rabbits but rabbits love cats

- Command Line: a1.exe upper cairo university
Expected output: CAIRO UNIVERSITY

- Command Line: a1.exe shue structure
Expected output: tsurtcrue

- Command Line: a1.exe shueStatement Egypt has goodies
Expected output: has Egypt goodies

- Command Line: a1.exe delete 3 12 5 good 3 nice
Expected output: 12 5 3 nice

- Command Line: a1.exe middle 3 12 5 good 3 nice
Expected output: 5 good

- Command Line: a1.exe add 4 5 6 2
Expected output: 17

- Command Line: a1.exe random 10 1 10 4
a1.exe random sequenceLength minNumber maxNumber seedValue
Expected output: 8 2 10 3 10 1 7 8 7 1

- ERROR Handling
 number of arguments shall be checked for , the follwing error messages are used :
